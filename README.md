I and most of my colleagues often use the site olx.in for selling/buying used products at cheap prices. 
Whenever I contact a seller/buyer through chat, I get anxious about their response and find myself browsing the site more often than not. Missing few messages might lead to potential monetary loss.
To solve this problem, I wrote a notifier that'll check if there are any new messages in my olx account.
That way, I don't have to worry about missing out on messages any more!
